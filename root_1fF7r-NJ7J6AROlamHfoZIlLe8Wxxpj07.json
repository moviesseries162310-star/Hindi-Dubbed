The pretext of being strangers, the darkly comic ritual that the broken, non-functioning brothers perform in an attempt to get at their pain, can't cover the palpable connection between them, nor their deeply felt desire to find redemption.  An accomplished pianist, Jay is working as a piano player in a lounge.

This act masks an underlying secret both men share about their childhood.",
